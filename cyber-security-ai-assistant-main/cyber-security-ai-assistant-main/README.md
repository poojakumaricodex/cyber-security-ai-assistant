## üìú System Prompt Design and Justification

### **Full System Prompt (Embedded in Code)**
```python
prompt = f"User: {{user_input}}\nAssistant:"
```

### **Justification and Impact Analysis**

#### **Breakdown of Elements**
- `"User: {user_input}"`: Identifies user input clearly to set conversational context.
- `"Assistant:"`: Signals the model to generate a response in the assistant‚Äôs persona.

#### **Design Choices**
- **Minimalistic structure** encourages concise, contextual, and natural language replies.
- Using `"Assistant:"` sets a role-based expectation that guides TinyLlama to follow a friendly, helpful tone.
- **Temperature = 0.7** is a balanced setting that supports creative yet accurate answers.
- **`max_new_tokens=256`** ensures long enough replies for explanation without overwhelming users.

#### **Anticipated Impact**
- Promotes user-friendly and consistent tone
- Helps reduce hallucinated or off-topic answers
- Makes the assistant behave predictably across varied queries

#### **Iteration & Refinement**
- Initially tested with plain user inputs ‚Üí added structured `"User:"` and `"Assistant:"` format
- Adjusted temperature from 1.0 to 0.7 for more focused, professional responses
